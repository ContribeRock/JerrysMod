# JerrysMod
Mod of Jerry
(I advice to not use this mod until it has a config unless you want all features to be enabled at all times)

## Features

* Your name is now Jerry forever.
* Shows amount of dungeon runs required below dungeon score in new dungeon RNG Meter
* Make sneaky creepers visible (Turn off patcher entity culling for esp to work)
* Highlight glass in crystal hollows (it has a keybind to toggle its 'G' as default)
